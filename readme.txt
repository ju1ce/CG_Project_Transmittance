This is a unity project, created with the latest version of Unity (2020.3.32f1).

The scene samplescene is setup to look at 3d objects, rendered using the implemented algorithms.

The scene analize is setup for analization of transmittance through a cube with varying majorant and density.

The main code is in Assets/analize in the form of .shader files. These are the finalized and cleaned up algorithms.
